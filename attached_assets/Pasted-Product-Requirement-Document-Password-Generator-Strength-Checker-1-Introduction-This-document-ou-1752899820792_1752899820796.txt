Product Requirement Document: Password Generator & Strength Checker
1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for a web-based "Password Generator & Strength Checker" tool. The goal is to provide users with a simple, secure, and intuitive way to generate strong, random passwords and to assess the strength of their existing or newly created passwords, offering suggestions for improvement.

2. Product Overview
The Password Generator & Strength Checker will be a free, accessible web application designed to enhance online security for individuals. It will feature two primary functionalities:

Password Generation: Users can generate highly customizable, strong passwords based on specified criteria.

Password Strength Checking: Users can input any password to receive an immediate strength assessment and actionable advice.

3. Goals
Empower Users: Provide users with the tools to create and verify strong passwords, thereby improving their personal online security.

Simplicity & Usability: Offer a clean, intuitive interface that is easy for users of all technical levels to navigate and understand.

Security Focus: Implement robust algorithms for password generation and strength assessment, ensuring the tool itself does not compromise user data.

Accessibility: Ensure the tool is accessible across various devices and browsers.

4. Target Audience
General internet users concerned about online security.

Individuals who frequently create new accounts or update passwords.

Developers or IT professionals needing quick password generation/validation.

Anyone seeking to improve their password hygiene.

5. Key Features
5.1. Password Generation
Customizable Length: Users must be able to specify the desired password length (e.g., a slider or input field from 8 to 128 characters).

Character Type Selection: Users must be able to select which character sets to include:

Uppercase letters (A-Z)

Lowercase letters (a-z)

Numbers (0-9)

Symbols (e.g., !@#$%^&*()_+{}[]:;"'<>,.?/|`~)

Exclude Ambiguous Characters (Optional): A checkbox to exclude characters that can be easily confused (e.g., l, 1, I, O, 0).

Exclude Duplicate Characters (Optional): A checkbox to ensure no character repeats within the generated password.

Generate Button: A clear button to trigger password generation based on selected criteria.

Display Generated Password: The generated password must be clearly displayed in a non-editable field.

Copy to Clipboard: A button to easily copy the generated password to the user's clipboard.

Security Note: The password should not be stored or logged by the application.

5.2. Password Strength Checking
Password Input Field: A text input field where users can type or paste a password.

Security Note: The input field should not store or transmit the password. All strength calculations must happen client-side.

Real-time Strength Indicator: As the user types, a visual indicator (e.g., a progress bar or color-coded text: Weak, Moderate, Strong, Very Strong) must update in real-time.

Strength Criteria Breakdown: Provide a clear breakdown of factors contributing to password strength:

Length

Inclusion of different character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

Presence of common patterns (e.g., "123456", "password")

Repetitive characters

Common dictionary words or names

Suggestions for Improvement: Offer actionable advice to strengthen the password (e.g., "Add more characters," "Include symbols," "Mix uppercase and lowercase").

Estimated Crack Time (Optional but Recommended): Display an estimated time it would take to crack the password (e.g., "instantly," "minutes," "years," "billions of years"). This should be based on common cracking algorithms and hardware.

5.3. User Interface/Experience
Responsive Design: The website must be fully responsive and optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Clean & Intuitive Layout: A simple, uncluttered design that prioritizes usability.

Clear Call-to-Actions: Buttons and interactive elements should be clearly labeled and easy to understand.

Help/Info Tooltips: Small tooltips or info icons to explain features or security concepts.

Dark Mode (Optional): Provide a toggle for a dark theme.

5.4. Security Considerations
Client-Side Processing: All password generation and strength checking logic must occur client-side (in the user's browser) to ensure passwords are never transmitted to the server.

No Data Storage: The application must not store, log, or transmit any user-entered passwords or generated passwords.

HTTPS: The website must be served over HTTPS to ensure secure communication.

No Third-Party Trackers (Minimal): Minimize the use of third-party analytics or tracking scripts to protect user privacy.

6. Technical Requirements (High-Level)
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS for styling), JavaScript (React for component-based development).

Password Strength Algorithm: Utilize a well-established and robust client-side library or algorithm (e.g., zxcvbn or a custom implementation based on entropy calculations) for password strength assessment.

Randomness: Ensure the password generation uses a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) available in modern browsers (e.g., window.crypto.getRandomValues).

Deployment: Static site hosting (e.g., Firebase Hosting, Netlify, Vercel).

Scalability: As a client-side application, scalability is primarily dependent on hosting infrastructure for serving static files.

7. Future Enhancements (Phase 2)
Passphrase Generator: Option to generate memorable passphrases using multiple random words.

Password History (Local Storage): An opt-in feature to store a hashed history of generated passwords locally in the user's browser (with clear warnings about security implications).

Browser Extension: A companion browser extension for quick access.

API for Developers: A simple API for developers to integrate password generation/checking into their own applications.
